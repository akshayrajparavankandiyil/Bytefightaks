	Majority of India still lives in villages and so the topic of rural education in India is of utmost importance. A survey named called the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), shows that even though the number of rural students attending schools is rising, but more than half of the students in fifth grade are unable to read a second grade text book and are not able to solve simple  mathematical problems. 
	Poverty is another setback. Government schools are not as good and private schools are expensive. This results in a very low number of students actually clearing their secondary education and taking admission in a colleges for further studies. So the drop-out-rate at the secondary level is extremely high in villages. Only parents who can afford college education send their kids to secondary schools. If parents are not able to send their wards for higher education then all their previous efforts get wasted as completing just secondary education means a low paying job and the person is again struck in the same never ending cycle of money, life and poverty.
	Our main goal is to provide the people who are passionate about their education and career by sponsoring them with the money needed for their education. We are basically focusing on building an app so that the aiding community who are ready to provide money can register themselves with us and do the needful to those in need of money to pursue their education. Money shouldn't be a barrier in people's life from pursuing their education. On the other hand those who are in need of money should also register themselves with us so that we can provide them with some help. We are trying to create a platform so that both the aiding community and the recipient can reach out with each other for the betterment of our society.
